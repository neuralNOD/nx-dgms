The governance of the data ensures that *"high-quality of data persists throughout the complete lifecycle of the data/applications"* that consumes
the data. The key focus areas of data governance include availability, usability, consistency, data integrity and data security, and standards
compliance. The practice also includes establishing processes to ensure effective data management throughout the enterprise, such as accountability
for the adverse effects of poor data quality, and ensuring that the data which an enterprise has can be used by the entire organization (for more
information check [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPsUjKLHLAg)).

The initial control and management of the data is controlled via a "schema" approach ([more information](../README.md)) while the essential policies
and/or rules is defined and maintained here. #TODO

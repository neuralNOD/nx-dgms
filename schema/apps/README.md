<h1 align = "center">Application Layer <code>apps</code> Schema</h1>

<div align = "justify">

The [**neuralNOD INC.**](https://github.com/neuralNOD) is a multi-product organization in development which is focused towards AI/ML applications.
The **`apps`** is a special schema with the table naming convention `apps.<product/project-acronym>.<table-name>` where the "project/product" name is
a funny internal acronym for the organizations.

## Limitations & Restrictions

The product/project name is desgined for internal usages and like popular naming styles
([Android Version Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history), [Linux Mint Naming Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Mint))
we have adopted *"Harry Potter Spells"* as the naming convention, as [I'm](https://zenithclown.github.io/) personally a *potterhead*!

* The names should be unique, and represents a motivation/theme behind the product/project, and
* The `<product/project-acronym>` identifier is always [7 characters](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Seven) or less
(well, 7 is the most powerful magical number)!

The schema definations are added as [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) and is restricted from public usage unless
specifically given access to. The submodules are named as the project name defined below. To start a new schema, use the
[template](https://github.com/neuralNOD/aberto) for a quick start.

## Project [*lumos*](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wand-Lighting_Charm) - The Illumination Project
